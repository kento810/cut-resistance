                    <p>Engineers create cut-resistant gloves by first understanding exactly how cuts occur, and then creating
						fiber and yarn technologies designed to defend against them. As shown in Figure 1, a slicing cut is the
						result of a downward force from a blade or sharp edge, combined with friction caused by the slicing motion
						between the edge and the material being cut. </p>
                    <p> <strong>Downward Force:</strong> The downward force creates high tension in the fabric. This is counteracted
						by the tensile strength of the material being cut. High strength materials typically have high density, and
						are more likely to bend than break under this downward force. A very sharp edge, though, will focus the
						force on a small area, increasing the likelihood of failure. Some materials counter this by dulling the
						blade or edge, which can greatly increase cut resistance.</p>

                        <p> <strong>Friction Force:</strong> As the blade moves across the surface, friction along the cutting edge
							removes material from the fabric. This results in thinner fibers, which weakens the fabric, and can result
							in a cut occurring.</p>
                        <p>

                                large downward forces.

                                <strong>Lubricity</strong> - low friction fibers reduce cutting edge friction, causing the blade to

                        <li><strong>Staple Fibers </strong> - these are typically composed of shorter strands that are wound together
                            to create a continuous fiber. Staple fibers have a 'fuzzy' finish, which gives a sensation of warmth to
                            the touch. They usually absorb fluids and perform well in high-heat environments. DuPont™ Kevlar® is a
                            man-made staple fiber; cotton and wool are natural staple fibers.

                        <li><strong>Filament Fibers </strong> - these fibers actually start out as a high viscosity liquid, typically
                            melted down from pellets. The liquid is then extruded, or drawn, to create a long smooth fiber. Filament
                            fibers have a smooth finish and are cool to the touch. They tend to wick fluids on their surface and

                    <p>Yarns are created by winding multiple fibers together on winding machines. The yarn fibers can all be
						similar, or they can be a blend of fibers each with different properties. Cut-resistant yarns are engineered
						by blending several different fibers, utilizing different winding arrangements (twist, wrap, helix, etc.),
						to create a yarn with specific properties - cut level, stretch, comfort, thickness, etc.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                    <p>Figure 4 is an example of an engineered yarn with multiple fibers. In this example the glass fiber core
						provides high strength, wound in a helix shape to improve flexibility. It is wrapped with HPPE fiber, which
						adds comfort and improves cut resistance, and spandex is wound along the length of the yarn to provide
						stretch and enhance fit of the glove. </p>
                    <p>During the winding process, engineers can precisely set the winding tension on the fibers, which can give
						the overall yarn structure the ability to 'roll' with a sharp edge or blade, increasing cut resistance even
						further.</p>
                    <p>Engineered yarns have revolutionized the field of cut-resistant gloves, and opened the door to a world of
						possibilities. Historically cut-resistant gloves were bulky, with poor dexterity, and often had low cut
						resistance. With today's engineered yarns, gloves with high cut resistance can be thin, comfortable, and
						have high dexterity as well. </p>

                        <p>Cut-resistant gloves are often categorized according to their 'gauge', which is a measurement borrowed
							from the fabric world. For fabrics, gauge is defined by the number of needles per inch on a stitching
							machine. This correlates directly to the number of stitches per inch on the fabric being made. On a knit
							glove, the gauge refers to the number of stitches (i.e. strands of yarn going up and down), per inch of
							the glove. In Figure 5, you can see that gloves with thick yarns have a lower gauge, such as 7 or 10, and
							gloves with finer yarns have a higher gauge, such as 15 or 18. In general, lower gauge gloves with thicker
							yarns will be heavier and bulkier than higher gauge gloves with thinner yarns. Gloves with thinner yarns
							offer higher dexterity and tactility, and are preferred for tasks that require precision and an increased
							sense of motor feedback. Gloves with heavier yarns are preferred for cold weather work and tasks that
							don't require a high level of dexterity. </p>

                        <p>Another look at Figure 5 reveals an important fact: on high-gauge gloves with thin yarns, there isn't
							much fabric protecting your hand from a blade or sharp edge. In order to effectively prevent cuts at these
							higher gauges, gloves must be made with state of the art engineered yarns, using a blend of different
							fibers to maximize strength, hardness, comfort, and stretch. </p>

                    <p>Most knit gloves receive a coating as the final assembly step. This involves a dipping process, in which
						the palm is drawn through a long trough filled with a heated liquid chemical compound, such as nitrile or
						latex. The glove is also exposed to cleaning agents, surface treatments, and then finished with a drying
						stage. The result is a flexible coating that provides enhanced grip for a variety of applications. </p>
                    <p>There are many different coating compounds, and each one has benefits for particular applications and
						environments. Table 2 compares four common coating compounds and highlights their different characteristics.
						In addition to different compounds, each coating will have a different surface finish. These surface
						finishes will enhance grip properties in the presence of different liquids and surfaces that the gloves come
						in contact with. Table 3 highlights different coating finishes and the particular benefits of each one. </p>
                    <p>Understanding the benefits of coatings and surface finishes will help you choose the right glove for the
						application. For example, a foamed nitrile coating will provide excellent grip in wet and oily environments
						and is particularly well-suited to jobsites where gloves are exposed to oils and hydrocarbons. And keep in
						mind that maintaining a good grip is critical to preventing workplace accidents.</p>

						Companies in North America follow guidelines set by the American National Standards Institute, or ANSI, and
						approved by the International Safety Equipment Organization, or ISEA. Ratings are specified in the document
						titled ANSI/ISEA 105. When testing for glove cut resistance, the following test method is used: ASTM
						F2992-15. This test is sometimes referred to as the TDM test, after the TDM-100 testing machine used in the
						test. </p>
                    <p>As shown in Figure 6, the test is performed by placing a fabric sample, taken from the palm of the glove,
						onto a curved mandrill. A specified vertical force is applied to a razor blade bringing it into contact with
						the fabric. The blade is then moved across the fabric until cut through is achieved, and the distance
						traveled is recorded. This process is repeated five times at three different vertical forces, each with a
						fresh razor blade. The results are charted and a 'trend line' is formed. This trend line is used to
						calculate the amount of force, in grams, required to cause a cut through at 20mm of blade travel. This
						result, in grams of force, is used to determine the ANSI/ISEA 105 cut rating for the glove, as shown in
						Table 4. </p>

						flaw: hardened fibers will dull the blade and cause the calculations to become dramatically skewed to the
						point of being useless. Thus, in 2016, the EN 388 standard was updated to include the same TDM test method
						found in the ANSI/ISEA 105 test method, with forces measured in Newtons instead of grams. This test is

						There are many hazards on a jobsite, so you must consider additional factors when deciding on the right hand
						protection. Below is a list of important glove features to consider when making that decision. Be sure to
						analyze ALL hazards, environmental factors, and human interface requirements at each jobsite and workplace.
						These include: </p>
                    <ul class="triangle-list">
                        <li><strong>Grip</strong> - a critical factor for all tasks, the right grip will help prevent objects from
                            slipping & slicing hands, and significantly reduce hand fatigue.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Touchscreen</strong> - with the proliferation of paperless workplaces and mobile devices, workers
                            must be able to use touchscreen devices without removing their gloves. This will greatly enhance hand
                            safety compliance.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Impact</strong> - in heavy industry, impact hazards are everywhere. Make sure that hands are
                            protected from cuts as well as impacts to the fingers, knuckles, and metacarpal bones with a glove from
                            the KONG® glove line.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Abrasion Resistance</strong> - working in highly abrasive environments can dramatically weaken cut
                            resistant gloves. Choose a glove with high abrasion leather and a full 360° cut liner, such as Ironclad's
                            ULD-IMPC5.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Chemical Resistance</strong> - knit gloves with only a palm coating will not protect users from
                            hazardous chemicals. Choose a fully coated glove, such as the Ironclad KCHA5, when working with caustic
                            and corrosive chemicals.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Cold Environments</strong> - working in cold environments or cold storage can cause loss of
                            dexterity and even frostbite. Choose a cut resistant glove with sufficient insulation.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Heat Resistance</strong>- when handling hot objects, it is important to consider the fiber
                            composition of the glove. HPPE can melt under high heat, so choose a heat-rated glove made from aramid
                            fibers such as DuPont™ Kevlar&reg;.

                    <p><strong>Compliance vs Catastrophe:</strong> When it comes to hand safety, compliance is the fine art of
						making sure that all workers are wearing protective gloves - and that they are wearing the right type of
						gloves for the hazards they encounter. </p>
                    <p>For example, Sandra works in the warehouse, so she needs cut level A1 touchscreen gloves. Roger handles
						sheet metal, so he requires cut level A4 gloves. Dewayne pulls hot metal parts off an assembly line,
						performs a brief grinding operation, and enters QC data on a tablet, so he needs heat resistant, touchscreen
						capable, cut level A5 gloves. Finally, there's Julia. Julia's job is to make sure that Sandra, Roger and
						Dewayne are all wearing gloves with the appropriate cut resistant level for the hazards they face on a daily
						basis. Therefore Julia needs a quick and efficient method of ensuring hand safety compliance across the
						entire workplace - and that's why we invented color-coded cut resistance. </p>
                    <p>So how did we do that? We started by adding a reinforcement to the saddle of our gloves, where the highest
						wear takes place. This reinforcement will double or triple the lifespan of the glove, reducing the overall
						cost of a hand safety program. Then, we developed a system of color coding that reinforcement, so safety
						professionals like Julia can rapidly scan the entire job site and easily evaluate if each worker is
						appropriately protected. Not only that, but Sandra, Roger and Dewayne can also perform the same quick check
						at the start of each shift.</p>
                    <p>Color-coded cut resistance, exclusively from Ironclad - the difference between compliance and
						catastrophe.</p>
